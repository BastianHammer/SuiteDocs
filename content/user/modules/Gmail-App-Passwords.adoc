= App Passwords

== Create an App Password

link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833[Google App Passwords] allows users to generate a password to be used for just one app. This way users don't have to use their Google Account password. Plus, they can generate different passwords for different apps, with the option to revoke a password at any given time.


=== 1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account

As described on link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833[Google App Password Documentation], this feature can only be used if the user has link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839[2-Step Verification] enabled on their Google account.

See the following documentation on how to turn on 2-step verification.

A modal should appear with your generated Password. Copy that password. After closing the modal you will not be able to see your password again. If you lose the password a new one will have to be generated. Please read the notes and instructions provided by Google.

=== 3. Use the password in your SuiteCRM instance

The generated App Password can and should be used as a regular password.

As an example we are going to go over how to use it in SuiteCRM's System Outbound Email configuration. It can also be used on the user email configuration and on the IMAP configuration (Inbound).


==== 3.1. Go to SuiteCRM administration page

.. Click on "Gmail" under "Choose your Email provider"
.. Add your email in `"From" Address:` and in `Gmail Email Address`
.. Copy the generated App Password and add it to `Gmail Password`
